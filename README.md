They say the best way to learn something is to teach it.  I agree!  And I love cybersecurity and teaching!  

I have been teaching exclusively cybersecurity for the last year.  I have taught successful students in CompTIA ITF+, Network+, Security+, PenTest+ and CASP+!

This experience has forced me to create my own labs and teaching material as well as branch out from the theortetical to the practical.  The CompTIA certifications are
a great primer for displaying an ability to focus and study, but they are only the first step in being a practitioner.  

Professionally, I am also a lab developer for Practice-Labs, creating lab content for PenTest+ that is used by Practice-Labs, ACI Learning, and ITPROTV! This experience was unique because the labs began with fully patched machines and I inserted vulnerabilities for exploitation. Students often ask me how to create thier own vulnerable lab environments.  My first answer is to strt with a premade vulnerable machine and work your way up to a customized vulnerable network.  ....inserting vulnerabilities for exploitation is a skill set all on its own!

I have been lucky enough to have wonderfully dedicated students from those who were new to IT to major program managers and Assistant CISOs to network and secuirty professionals and even professional athlethes!  And I am greatful to have recieved positive feedback.  Below are a few examples:

"Jeremiah breaks down material in a digestible and comprehensive way."
- Aysha Sweilem

"I feel much more confident taking my exam now versus when I first started these sessions.  Thank you Jeremiah!"
- Aysha Sweilem

"I passed the CompTIA Secuirty+ exam largely because of Jeremiah's broad and robust cybersecurity knowledge.  In addition, Jeremiah custom tailored his curriculum to
suit my needs as a student starting in the cybersecurity landscape.  I could not be happier with a tutor like him as he took me to the next level"
- Shmuel Johnson

"Thank you Jeremiah for believing in me and working with me to improve my weak areas for CompTIA Security+. I'm still in shock that I passed my exam!! I know that
this wouldn't be possible without all of your help! You exceeded all of my expectations for a tutor and I look forward to working with you in the future! Again,
thank you for always answering my questions and even being available for a quick call/ text/email just days before my exam! You are literally the best!!! Thank you
thank you thank you, I just can't thank you enough!!!"
- Malaysha White

"Jeremiah did a great job on our tutoring session! I was really surprised that Varsity Tutors was able to come up with a person that knew the exact material I was
looking to learn. He gave me the exact tools and information to use in order to pass my certification. As a direct result, I was able to pass the CASP+ 004
certification."
- James Steel

"Excelente material, answered my questions and very patient. "
-Ruben Gordils

ABOUT ME

I am a senior Navy officer transitioning out of the military to the cybersecurity industry, with a passion for Penetration Testing and teaching.  With 23+ years in the US Navy, I have been a leader at all levels and am comfortable operating and teaching at both the technical and executive levels.

The stereotype of senior military officers is that they have a tremendous amount of military operational experience and leadership, but little-to-no technical hands-on expertise.  I come to the table with operational experience, leadership, AND technical-hands-on acumen.  As a Navy Nuclear Engineer, in extreme conditions, I designed and implemented new and complex engineering solutions to life sustaining equipment.  As a Navy officer, with more technical expertise than the IT department that worked for me, I designed and managed technical solutions to implement secure access to navy systems and a recurring deficiency tracking software solution.  Throughout my military career I have steered toward the administration and oversight of communications and IT systems at every possible opportunity, resulting in being the program establishing ISSO for a Navy warship and the Authorizing Official and IT technical advisor for programs supporting DoD missions.

I am available and ready for additional full-time employment now.  At the Denver Navy Reserve Center, I am the primary (and only) application developer to create and maintain a Microsoft Access program that collates, filters, and prioritizes raw data for more than 800 Navy Reserve Personnel.  

In 2021, I completed 5 CompTIA certifications, though CASP+, in a period of months and without any exam failures.  I am an instructor for CompTIA, ACI Learning, and El Camino College, teaching cybersecurity certification programs to IT professionals (such as System Admins, Directors of IT, Assistant CISOs, and multi-million-dollar program managers) as well as new cybersecurity degree graduates and professional athletes.  To support my students, I develop hands-on labs using Cisco Packet Tracer, Virtual Machine labs, and open-source products.  I have created and present walkthroughs of technical applications, such as the use of the OpenVAS scanner, SearchSploit, Exploit DB, and the Metasploit Framework to both understand (through scripts) and conduct (through payloads/exploits) ethical hacking on virtual targets.  Additionally, as a lab developer for Practice-Labs, I created the PT0-002 (PenTest+) lab product used by Practice-Labs, ACI Learning, and ITPROTV.

To maintain and develop my own technical expertise I am an active member of the CompTIA Instructor network and I routinely take my students though Capture the Flag (CTF) and vulnerability challenges, using OWASP Webgoat, PicoCTF, and Over the Wire.  

I have the experience to work at technical, mentor, and leadership levels in the cybersecurity industry and I am very comfortable in new and dynamic situations as well as interfacing with both junior and executive level personnel.
