Hi, I'm Jeremiah Minner.  My goal is to be a penetration tester/ethical hacker.

I am a senior Navy officer transitioning out of the military to the cybersecurity industry, with a passion for Penetration Testing/Ethical Hacking and teaching.
With 22+ years in the US Navy, I have been a leader at all levels and am comfortable operating and teaching at both the technical and executive levels.

The stereotype of senior military officers is that they have a tremendous amount of military operational experience and leadership, but little-to-no
technical hands-on expertise.  I come to the table with operational experience, leadership, AND technical-hands-on acumen.  As a Navy Nuclear Engineer,
in extreme conditions, I designed and implemented new and complex engineering solutions to life sustaining equipment.  As a Navy officer, with more
technical expertise than the IT department that worked for me, I designed and managed technical solutions to implement secure access to navy systems and
a recurring deficiency tracking software solution.  Throughout my military career I have steered toward the administration and oversight of communications
and IT systems at every possible opportunity, resulting in being the program establishing ISSO for a Navy warship and the Authorizing Official and
IT technical advisor for programs supporting DoD missions.

I am available and ready for additional full-time employment now.  Recognizing and planning for Navy retirement, I created a remote position for myself
at the Denver Navy Reserve Center.  I am the primary (and only) application developer to create and maintain a Microsoft Access program that collates,
filters, and prioritizes raw data for more than 750 Navy Reserve Personnel.  

In 2021, I completed 5 CompTIA certifications, though CASP+, in a period of months and without any exam failures.  To immediately use my knowledge, I began
working for Varsity Tutors, teaching cybersecurity certification programs to IT professionals (such as System Admins, Directors of IT, and multi-million
dollar program IT managers) as well as new cybersecurity degree graduates.  To support my students, I develop hands-on labs using Cisco Packet Tracer,
Virtual Machine labs, and open-source products.  Additionally, I have created and present walkthroughs of technical applications, such as the use of the
OpenVAS scanner, SearchSploit, Exploit DB, and the Metasploit Framework to both understand (through scripts) and conduct (through payloads/exploits)
ethical hacking on virtual targets.  

To maintain and develop my own technical expertise I am an active member of the CompTIA Instructor network and I routinely take my students though
Capture the Flag (CTF) and vulnerability challenges, using OWASP Webgoat, PicoCTF, and Over the Wire.  You can view some of the labs I have created
and solutions in my github repositories.

Through my Navy career, I have lived in the US, England, Canada, and Japan.  I have also traveled as the primary contact representing the US and 
Canadian Navy for interational contracts and planning in the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Italy, France, South Korea, Japan, and Australia. I have also
had the opportunity to brief and work with senior military leaders (at the Chief of Naval Operations and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff levels)
from multiple countries.

I have the experience to work at technical, mentor, and leadership levels in the cybersecurity industry and I am very comfortable in new and dynamic
situations as well as working with both junior and executive level personnel.
